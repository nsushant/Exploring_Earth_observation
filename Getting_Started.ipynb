    "Now for some images. Raster data is represented in earth engine through Image objects. \n",

    "But what is a raster image ? The AI generated response below explains this concept well. \n",
    "\n",
    "A raster image is a type of digital image that is composed of a grid or matrix of pixels, where each pixel represents a discrete value or color. In contrast to vector graphics, which are based on mathematical equations to represent shapes, raster images are based on a grid of individual picture elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of raster images include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixels: The basic building blocks of a raster image are pixels, which are small square or rectangular elements arranged in a grid. Each pixel contains information about the color or intensity of the image at that specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution: The resolution of a raster image is determined by the number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Higher resolution images have more pixels and can represent more detail, but they also require more storage space and processing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color Depth: Raster images can be grayscale (one channel), or they can have multiple color channels (e.g., red, green, and blue for a color image). The number of bits used to represent each pixel's color value determines the color depth and the range of colors that can be represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Formats: Common file formats for raster images include JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP. Each format has its own characteristics and is suitable for different types of images and applications.\n",
    "Photographic Realism: Raster images are well-suited for representing photographic and continuous-tone images, such as photographs and detailed graphics. They are not as well-suited for representing sharp, scalable shapes, which is a strength of vector graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These images are particularly effective at representing complex scenes with continuous tones and intricate details. However, raster images can suffer from pixelation when enlarged, and their file sizes can become large, especially at high resolutions."
